                    <p>The academic policy decisions for the Institute are to be taken up by the Senate of the Institute. However, the Institute is still in its infancy with only a few faculty members, who have the major responsibility of sharing the teaching load and implementing a unique undergraduate curriculum of the Institute. No Deputy Director has been appointed yet. Also, since the Institute is envisaged to be a border-less cross-disciplinary place of learning, the existence of separate conventional academic departments has not occurred. In view of promoting the participative administrative governance in the Institute, Institute Administrative Group (IAG) for the General Administration (IAG-GA), operate at present.</p>
