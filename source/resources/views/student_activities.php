Every year, both during winter and summer vacation, students are going to Japan for 10 days exposure visit, in which they not only visit leading industries, renowned laboratories and leading academic universities, but also are introduced to Japanese culture. Both Industry and academia of Japan are now having a very good impression of capabilities of our students and eager to place the students, both for MS program and in industry. Few among them are AMADA, Canon and GE energy. Some students are now pursuing MS in Japan’s leading academic Institutions, University of Tokyo and Tokyo Institute of Technology. With the introduction of project based internship (PBI) in the curriculum, in the year 2012 five students had been offered six month long internship in MHI, Canon and Chiba University. Based on their performance during internship, the students shall be offered jobs in respective companies.</p><br />
